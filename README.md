# FeedApp
#### Project desciption
Today we live in a world where information is an important factor in our lives, and we can now access this information very easily thanks to a tool which can be in our pockets which is none other than the smartphone.
    
With the emergence of the Smartphone and its massification, the mobile phone has profoundly affected our perceptual structures and our way of being in everyday life.
For companies and brands, mobile applications have become an essential means of creating new services for mobile users, which is why the Mint IT https://mintit.io/ mobile development box seeks to improve its brand image by testing their applications on a multitude of phones to offer better quality products.

The number of smartphones it has which is fifteen in number is not enough to ensure the good quality of applications, and with such a powerful community on the Internet, the development box Mint IT https://mintit.io/ proposed to our group mini project "House Targaryen" to develop the FeedUp application which allows users to evaluate the applications that the box develops by giving their opinions or by reporting a bug or any problem, in the form of a form.

They will be later on rewarded with points that they can exchange for money.
